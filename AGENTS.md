# Permission changes

- Whenever a permission is added or changed, implement the matching frontend conditions in the same change. Check all related buttons, links, navigation items, menus, forms, and submission handlers.
- Use `usePermissions().hasPermissions(['resource.action'])` with the exact permission name enforced by the backend. Shared `auth.permissions` is evaluated by Laravel authorization from `PermissionRegistry`; do not infer permissions from role names. Missing permissions must deny access by default.
- Hide unauthorized actions and navigation, including empty action columns and menu groups. Preserve record-specific restrictions such as preventing self-deletion or deleting assigned roles.
- Keep backend authorization in place: frontend visibility is not a security boundary. Verify both allowed and denied users, including permissions inherited through roles, when changing permissions.

- `hasPermissions(permissionNames, checkAll = false)` accepts an array: by default any allowed permission grants access (return immediately on the first match); pass `true` to require every listed permission. An empty array denies access. Use this helper for all frontend permission checks.
